            Pokémon: Indigo League (originally aired simply as Pokémon) is the first season of the Pokémon animated television
            series and the first season of Pokémon: The Original Series, known in Japan as Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto

            It's Ash Ketchum's tenth birthday, and he's ready to do what many 10-year-olds in the Kanto region set out to do—become
            a Pokémon Trainer! Things don't go exactly the way he planned when he ends up with a Pikachu instead of a standard first
            Pokémon, and winning Gym Badges turns out to be much tougher than he thought. Luckily he's got former Gym Leaders Brock
            and Misty at his side, along with a bevy of new Pokémon friends, including Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander.

            This season, the narrator of the Pokémon anime (voiced in Japanese by Unshō Ishizuka, and in English by Rodger Parsons)
            will follow the beginning adventures of Ash Ketchum (voiced in Japanese by Rika Matsumoto, and in English by Veronica
            Taylor), a 10-year-old aspiring Pokémon trainer from Pallet Town who is given a Pikachu (voiced by Ikue Ōtani) by
            Pokémon researcher Professor Oak to begin his Pokémon journey. Ash is driven by his desire to win the Indigo Plateau's
            Pokémon League, a challenging tournament for outstanding Pokémon trainers who compete against each other in Pokémon
            battles. To qualify for the tournament, Ash must collect the required number of gym badges, which are tokens earned
            after defeating each of the Kanto region's elite Pokémon gym leaders. Early in the season, Ash befriends the water-type
            Pokémon trainer Misty, who befriends Ash in hopes of him replacing her destroyed bicycle, and Brock, a Pokémon breeder
            who is the leader of the Pewter City gym.

            <h2>Pokémon Latest Game</h2>

        <p>
            Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet are 2022 role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo
            and The Pokémon Company for the Nintendo Switch. They are the first instalments in the ninth generation of the Pokémon
            video game series.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unlike the previous instalments in the Pokémon franchise, Scarlet and Violet take place in an open world. The games take
            place in the Paldea region, based on the Iberian Peninsula. There are three separate stories the player can follow.
            Scarlet and Violet introduce 103 new Pokémon, alongside two new regional forms. Also introduced are time-displaced
            creatures known as Paradox Pokémon, and the Terastal phenomenon, which allows a Pokémon to transform into its
            exclusive "Tera Type". The games maintain features from previous modern Pokémon games, including large open areas and
            Pokémon appearing in the overworld.

            Scarlet and Violet received mixed reviews from critics. The games were praised for their open world formula and story,
            while their graphics and technical problems at launch received criticism. The games sold over 10 million copies in their
            first three days, making them Nintendo's biggest launch of all time.
            <br>
            <br>
            According to The Pokémon Company, Scarlet and Violet are the most pre-ordered titles in the series' history. Within
            three days of its release, the games had sold over 10 million copies worldwide, including 4.05 million in Japan alone.
            The sales figure was the highest of any software on any Nintendo platform within three days, and the best launch
            of any console-exclusive game in history. The games were the best-selling video game titles of 2022 in Japan.
